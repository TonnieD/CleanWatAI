Add saturated sodium sulphate, methanol, iso-propanol or two-octanol to break down the emulsions. Add iso-octane and concentrate the combined extract, using a rotary evaporator flask. The extract is loaded on a Florisil® column and four separate fractions are eluted using hexane, 6% ethyl ether in petroleum ether, 15% ethyl ether in petroleum ether, then 50% ethyl ether in petroleum ether or chloroform. Concentrate in a rotary flask, transfer to a graduated centrifuge tube. Add iso-octane as a keeper and concentrate under a gentle stream of nitrogen at 40°C. The sample extract is then injected into a dual column GC/ECD and quantified, according to its retention time and peak height/area, using a multi-point calibration curve. Confirmation is achieved by chemical derivation techniques, TLC, or Mass Spectrometry.
 Interference: Other pesticide residues and their degradation products or metabolites and organic compounds, other than OCs and PCBs, may interfere. As many of these compounds cannot be separated, confirmation is required.

Concentrate in a rotary flask, transfer to a graduated centrifuge tube. Add iso-octane as a keeper and concentrate under a gentle stream of nitrogen at 40°C. The sample extract is then injected into a dual column GC/ECD and quantitated, according to its retention time and peak height/area, using a multi-point calibration curve. Confirmation is achieved by chemical derivation techniques, TLC, or Mass Spectrometry. Interference: Other pesticide residues and their degradation products or metabolites and organic compounds, other than OCs and PCBs, may interfere. As many of these compounds cannot be separated, confirmation is required.

Total alkalinity is determined in a whole water sample by potentiometric titration of a sample aliquot with a standard solution of sulphuric acid. This method employs an automated titrator which makes incremental additions of titrant to the sample and plots a titration curve. The titration curve is a plot of pH vs volume of titrant added. The endpoint of the titration is determined by analysis of the titration curve using a first derivative function to find the inflection point (curve changes from concave to convex or vice versa). The inflection point represents the stoichiometric equivalence point for the neutralization of the carbonates and other bases present. The total alkalinity is given by the equation F*X, where X= ml of acid needed to titrate to the inflection point and F is a factor derived from standardization of the acid. The factor F, incorporates the concentration of the acid used in the titration, the volume of sample analyzed and the conversion of the units to mg/L CaCO3.
Alk-Tot;Alk-T-POT-GRN;mg/l;Total Alkalinity;Gran Titration;Titration;ENV 372;Environment Canada 1995;"The Gran Function employs an algorithm to determine inflection points from titration curves that are not well defined. The titration curves of low ionic strength soft waters and precipitation samples fall into this category. Total alkalinity of these samples is determined by titration with sulphuric acid employing an automatic titrator which makes incremental addition of titrant and plots a titration curve of pH against volume of titrant. Add 0.25mL 1 N KCl to 100mL of sample, then titrate to pH 3.7 with 0.001N HCl. 
 To use the Gran function, small increments of acid are added beyond the expected inflection point. Record both the incremental volumes added, and the corresponding pH. The volume corrected H+ concentration is plotted against the volume of added acid. The alkalinity is determined from extrapolation of the linear portion of the curve on the abscissa. Total alkalinity is given by the equation F*X, where X= ml of acid needed to titrate to the inflection point and F is a factor derived from standardization of the acid. The factor F incorporates the concentration of the acid used in the titration, the volume of sample analyzed, and the conversion of the units to mg/L CaCO3.

Add saturated sodium sulphate, methanol, iso-propanol or two-octanol to break down the emulsions. Add iso-octane and concentrate the combined extract, using a rotary evaporator flask. The extract is loaded on a Florisil® column and four separate fractions are eluted using hexane, 6% ethyl ether in petroleum ether, 15% ethyl ether in petroleum ether, then 50% ethyl ether in petroleum ether or chloroform. Concentrate in a rotary flask, transfer to a graduated centrifuge tube. Add iso-octane as a keeper and concentrate under a gentle stream of nitrogen at 40°C. The sample extract is then injected into a dual column GC/ECD and quantitated, according to its retention time and peak height/area, using a multi-point calibration curve. Confirmation is achieved by chemical derivation techniques, TLC, or Mass Spectrometry. Interference: Other pesticide residues and their degradation products or metabolites and organic compounds, other than OCs and PCBs, may interfere. As many of these compounds cannot be separated, confirmation is required.

BOD;BOD-ISE;mg/l;Biochemical Oxygen Demand;5-Day BOD Test using Membrane Electrode;Electrochemical Analysis;"5210 B;4500-O G";APHA 2012;"BOD is a measure of the oxygen demand produce by carbonaceous and nitrogenous materials in a sample. It is measured by determining the decrease of oxygen content, using a dissolved oxygen meter, after incubation at 20°C for five days.
 A sample is preserved in the field at 4°C and the analysis started within four hours. The sample aliquot is incubated, at 20°C for five days under proper conditions. The procedure depends on the nature of the sample. After aeration of the samples to bring the dissolved oxygen content to saturation, one of the following three variations can be used, depending on the type of samples to be analysed:
 1 - The direct method: If the BOD does not exceed 7 mg/L, then the BOD is determined directly by measuring the dissolved oxygen content of the water, before and after a five days incubation period at 20°C.
 2 - Unseeded dilution method: For waters having BOD values greater than 7 mg/L: appropriate sample aliquots are diluted using dilution water, saturated with oxygen, and the oxygen content is determined before and after the incubation period. A minimum of three dilutions per sample, with a final content between 40% and 70% of the original oxygen concentration, will give best results.
 3 - Seeded dilution method: It is extremely important that the conditions be appropriate for the living organisms to function unhindered during the incubation period. Toxic substances should be absent, and necessary nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, should be present. It is important that a mixed group of organisms (called ""seed"") should be present during the test. The dilution water is seeded with the proper kind and number of organisms and saturated with oxygen (overnight) before the BOD test.
 Siphon the diluted sample to fill three BOD bottles; one for incubation (five days), one for the determination of the dissolved oxygen content (measured and record as ""initial DO"") and the other for the determination of the immediate dissolved oxygen demand (IDOD), after a 15 minutes incubation period. A minimum of three dilutions per sample, with a final content between 40% and 70% of the original oxygen concentration, will give best results.
 Use a calibrated oxygen meter to measure the oxygen concentrations before and after incubation.
 Interference: Many synthetic organic components from industrial wastewaters are not biodegradable without adding seeding water due to the toxic effect or the absence or deficiency of appropriate microorganisms. Sample containing residual Cl2, that is acidic or alkaline, must be neutralized to pH=7, and sometimes titrated with a Na2S2O3 solution to liberate the chloride from solution. A sample, containing sulphide, sulphite and/or ferrous ions, creates an immediate demand, corrected by the IDOD.
 The method detection limit is 1 mg/L."
BOD;BOD-T-COL-AZD;mg/l;Biochemical Oxygen Demand;5-Day BOD Test using Acide Modification;Titration;"5210 B;4500-O C";APHA 2012;"Biochemical Oxygen Demand is defined as the quantity of oxygen necessary for biological and chemical oxidation of water-borne substances under conditions of the test. A sample is preserved in the field at 4°C and the analysis started within 4 hours. A sample is incubated at 20°C under proper conditions. Comparison of the dissolved oxygen content at the beginning and the end of the incubation period is the measure of the Biochemical Oxygen Demand. The procedure depends on the nature of the sample. After aeration of the samples to bring the dissolved oxygen content to saturation, one of the following three variations can be used, depending on the type of samples to be analysed:
 A - The direct method: If the BOD does not exceed 7 mg/L, the BOD is determined directly by measuring the dissolved content of the water sample before and after a five days incubation period at 20°C.

 Siphon the diluted sample to fill three BOD bottles; one for incubation (five days), one for the determination of the dissolved oxygen content (measured and record as ""initial DO""), and the other for the determination of the immediate dissolved oxygen demand (IDOD), after a 15 minutes incubation period (to eliminate the oxygen demand from sulphide, sulphite and/or ferrous ions). A minimum of three dilutions per sample, with a final content between 40% and 70% of the original oxygen concentration, will give best results.
 DO Winkler method:
 A sample is treated with manganous sulphate (MnSO4) and a strong alkaline iodide reagent (NaN3, NaI and NaOH). The manganous hydroxide reacts with the dissolved oxygen to form a brown precipitate (MnO(OH)2. Let stand for one hour. Upon acidification, with concentrated H2SO4, in the presence of iodide, the iodine liberated is equivalent to the dissolved oxygen originally present in the sample. The iodide is titrated with a standardized sodium thiosulphate (Na2S2O3), using starch as an indicator.
 Interference: Many synthetic organic components from industrial wastewaters are not biodegradable without adding seeding water. Sample containing residual Cl2, that is acidic or alkaline, must be neutralized to pH=7 and titrated with Na2S2O3 solution. The IDOD is determined to eliminate the oxygen demand of sulphide, sulphite and/or ferrous ions.
 The method detection limit is 0.01 mg/L.
 NOTE: India uses 27° and 3 days because of geoclimatic conditions."

The analysis is conducted by ion chromatography and determined in conjunction with other anions. An ion exchange process separates the ions of interest based on the affinity for the exchange sites of the resin bed. The sample is then pumped through the suppressor which reduces the background conductivity of the eluent to a negligible level by converting the anions in the sample to their respective acid forms . The concentrations of these separated anions are determined by measuring their respective conductivities using a conductivity detector. Anions are identified by their retention times compared to known calibration standards.

After irradiation, the sample is buffered at pH 5.2 with a potassium dihydrogen phosphate and disodium hydrogen phosphate solution and the HCN is distilled out of the phosphoric acids solution. It is then converted to cyanogen chloride, CNCl, by reaction with Chloradine-T. The CNCl is finally mixed with a mixture a Pyridine-Barbituric reagent and forms a blue dye. The intensity of the colour produced is measured spectrometrically at 580 nm, and compared to identically-prepared KCN standard and blank solutions.

The sample aliquot is refluxed for two hours in concentrated H2SO4 with a known amount of K2Cr2O7, containing sulphamic acid against the interference of nitrites, HgSO4 against the interferences of chlorides, and Ag2SO4, as a catalyst for organic compounds. The sample is cooled and the excess dichromate is titrated with standardised ferrous ammonium sulphate (Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2), using ferroin (a complex of ferrous ion and 1,10-phenanthroline) as an indicator. The amount of oxidizable organic matter is proportional to the dichromate consumed. A reagent blank is identically analysed. The concentration of COD is calculated from the difference between sample and blank aliquots.

COL-True;COLOR-Vis;TCU;True Color;Visual Comparison;;PYR 24;Environment Canada 2007;"True colour refers to the colour of water from which the suspended material has been removed. Apparent colour refers to the colour of water that includes both the colour due to materials in solution and that due to turbidity.
 This method measures colour that results from natural occurring substances. The colour in the water sample is determined by visual comparison with known concentrations of coloured standard solutions. The unit of colour in the platinum-cobalt method is defined as being that produced by one milligram of platinum in the form of the chloroplatinate ion. The stock solution prepared at 500 colour units is composed of potassium chloroplatinate (K2PtCl6), and cobaltous chloride (C°Cl2.6H2O) in 10% hydrochloric acid. The solution is diluted in 50 mL Nessler tubes to form a series of standard colour solutions in the range expected for naturally occurring surface waters. For apparent colour, the whole water sample is shaken, poured in a Nessler tube and the tube then placed alongside the standards. Visual comparison and matching is conducted by looking vertically downward through the tubes, which have been placed over a lighted white surface, such that, light is reflected upward through the columns of liquid. For true colour, the turbidity is removed by filtration through 0.45 um membrane filter paper and the filtrate analyzed."

The method is based on the displacement of thiocyanate ion (SCN) from mercuric thiocyanate by chloride ion and the subsequent reaction of the liberated thiocyanate with ferric ion, from an acidified (nitric acid) ferric ammonium sulphate solution, forming a coloured complex with ferric thiocyanate. This colour is proportional to the original chloride concentration and is measured spectrometrically at 480 nm. The sample is compared to identically-prepared standard and blank solutions.

 Interference: Temperature differences between sample aliquot and standard solutions must be carefully controlled.
 A surface layer of silver may be formed by reducing salts when the electrode needs to be polished. Mercury must be absent, and complexing chloride agents reduce the chloride concentration, as only free ions are measured.

After re-sampling and air segmentation, persulphate and mercury(II) nitrate solutions are added and the mixed liquid stream is pumped through a quartz coil where it is exposed to a low intensity ultraviolet light, used as a source of energy. This process oxidizes the dissolved organic carbon to CO2 which by means of a gas permeable silicon membrane is dissolved in a weakly buffered thymol blue indicator solution. The colour change of the acid-base indicator is measured at 590 nm and is proportional to the concentration of dissolved organic carbon in a water sample.

 The specific conductance is measured, using a radiometer CDM 83, automatic ranging conductivity meter and a radiometer type CDC 334 jacketed platinum electrode. A one-gallon water bath, with a HAAKE Model E52 temperature controller/circulation pump (or equivalent), accurately maintains the temperature bath at 25°C (± 0.1°C) and continually circulates water through the cell jacket. The sample aliquot is drawn into the conductivity cell via a vacuum and specific conductivity is read directly from the meter after a fifteen second temperature stabilization period. The radiometer is calibrated on a per use basis.

Growth of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci on bile esculin agar and at 45°C, in brain-heart infusion broth, verifies that the colony is of the fecal streptococcus group (growth at 45°C and in 6.5% NaCl broth indicates that the colony belongs to the enterococcus group)."

This test is conducted by taking the asbestos filter mat containing the residue for the total suspended solids (non-filterable residue) and placing it in a muffle furnace set at 550°C for 30 minutes. The filter is then cooled in a desiccator and the filter reweighed to constant weight. The increase in weight over that of the empty filter represents the fixed suspended solids.

The titration method depends on the ability of the ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and its sodium salts to form stable unionised complexes with calcium and magnesium ions. A buffer solution (NH4Cl, NH4OH, and Mg salt of EDTA) is added to a sample aliquot to adjust the pH between 10.1 - 10.2, followed by an indicator (Eriochrome Black T) (See Appendix 8) forming a pink complex. Upon titration, the EDTA removes the calcium and magnesium from the complex dye and changes the solution to its original blue colour as an end point.

Fill with sample and add 0.5 mL of 6N NaOH solution. Mix solution together and add enough NaOH to reach a pH above 9. Let precipitate rest for 30 min. Collect precipitate on glass fibre filter and continue with titration. Titration: Measure from a buret into a 500mL flask an amount of iodine solution estimated to be an excess amount over the amount of sulphide present. Add distilled water if necessary to bring volume to 20mL. Add 2mL 6N HCl. Pipet 200mL sample into flask. If iodine colour disappears add more iodine until colour remains. Back titrate with Na2S2O3 solution adding a few drops of starch solution as endpoint is approached and continuing until blue colour disappears. If the sulphide was precipitated with zinc and ZnS filtered out, return filter with precipitate to original bottle and add about 100mL water. Add iodine solution and HCl and titrate as per instructions above.

Add saturated sodium sulphate, methanol, iso-propanol or two-octanol to break down the emulsions. Add iso-octane and concentrate the combined extract, using a rotary evaporator flask. The extract is loaded on a Florisil® column and four separate fractions are eluted using hexane, 6% ethyl ether in petroleum ether, 15% ethyl ether in petroleum ether, then 50% ethyl ether in petroleum ether or chloroform. Concentrate in a rotary flask, transfer to a graduated centrifuge tube. Add iso-octane as a keeper and concentrate under a gentle stream of nitrogen at 40°C. The sample extract is then injected into a dual column GC/ECD and quantified, according to its retention time and peak height/area, using a multi-point calibration curve. Confirmation is achieved by chemical derivation techniques, TLC, or Mass Spectrometry.
 Interference: Other pesticide residues and their degradation products or metabolites and organic compounds, other than OCs and PCBs, may interfere. As many of these compounds cannot be separated, confirmation is required.

The nitrate content in the sample aliquot is reduced to nitrite in the presence of zinc dust in alkaline medium. The resulting nitrites, plus the original nitrites, are reacted with sulfanilamide and with alpha naphthylamide to form a highly coloured azo dye. The azo dye colour intensity, proportional to the nitrate plus nitrite concentration, is determined colourimetrically at 530 nm and compared to identically prepared standard ad blank solutions.

The resulting nitrites (those originally present plus those resulting from the reduction) give a diazotization reaction with sulfanilamide, coupled with alpha-naphthyl-ethylenediamine hydrochloride, to form a pink complex, whose intensity of coloration , measured at 540 nm, is proportional to the initial concentration of Nitrates + Nitrites present in the sample.

O2-Dis;O2-ISE;mg/l;Dissolved Oxygen;Membrane Electrode Method;Electrochemical Analysis;SM 4500-O G;APHA 2012;Measurements are made in the field using a calibrated dissolved oxygen meter. The electronic cell, containing a gold cathode and a silver anode, is covered with an Oxygen permeable membrane to prevent interferences. Upon entering the cell, the Oxygen is reduced and the current is directly proportional to the oxygen concentration at a specific temperature. The DO ranges are usually automatically temperature corrected (between -50C and + 40°C), as are the solubility and permeability of the probe, while salinity usually needs manual compensation. Regular calibration against the Winkler Titration Method is recommended or by exactly following the manufacturer's procedure. (DO meter is calibrated in air saturated with moisture and the reading is taken when steady condition is obtained).

A sample aliquot is treated with manganous sulphate (MnSO4) and a strong alkaline iodide reagent (NaN3, NaI and NaOH). The manganous hydroxide formed reacts with the dissolved oxygen to form a brown precipitate (MnO(OH)2 (a KF solution is added if ferrous ions are present). Upon acidification, in the presence of iodide, the iodine liberated is equivalent to the dissolved oxygen originally present in the sample. The iodide is titrated with a standardized sodium thiosulphate solution (Na2S2O3), starch is used as an indicator.
 Interferences: ferrous ion at 1 mg/L (if KF is added the interference level for ferrous ion is 100-200 mg/L), SO3 ion, S2O3 ion, polythionate ions, free Cl2, OCl ion, oxidizing and reducing agents, and turbidity."

The results are an estimate of the mean density of coliforms in the sample and are reported as most probable number (MPN). Unless a large portion of fermentation tubes are used, the precision is low.
 Presumptive Phase:
 Use sufficient medium (lauryl tryptose broth) in fermentation tubes, incubate at 20°C overnight before use and discard tubes with growth or bubbles.
 Arrange fermentation tubes in rows of five or ten in test tube rack. For potable water, use five 20mL portions, ten 10mL portions tubes or a single 100mL portion. For non-potable water, use five tubes per dilution (10, 1.0, 0.1 mL, etc). Shake sample well, inoculate and mix test tubes in the medium by gentle agitation. Incubate inoculated tubes or bottles at 35°C ± 0.5°C. [Japan uses 36°C ± 1°C.] After 24 hours, swirl each container and check for growth, gas or acidic reaction (producing a shade of yellow colour) and document. If absent, re-incubate for another 24 hours. The absence of acidic reaction or gas formation constitutes a negative test.
 Confirmed Phase:
 Submit all presumptive tubes with growth, gas or acidic reaction. Transfer culture to the fermentation tube (containing brilliant green lactose bile broth) or insert a sterile applicator into the culture, quickly remove and insert to the bottom of fermentation tube containing the broth. Remove and discard applicator. Repeat for all positive presumptive tubes. Incubate at 35°C ± 0.5°C. [Japan uses 36°C ± 1°C.] Formation of gas at any time within 48 hours ± 3 hours constitutes a positive confirmed phase.
 Alternative Procedure (for polluted waters):
 If all presumptive tubes are positive in two or more consecutive dilutions within 24 hours, only submit, to the confirmed phase, all tubes with the highest dilution (also submit all positive tubes produced after 48 hours).
 Calculate the MPN value from the number of positive brilliant green lactose bile tubes."

TURB;NEPH-Ratio;NTU;Turbidity;Nephelometric Method (Ratio Turbidimeter);;SM 2130 B;APHA 2012;"Turbidity in water is caused by suspended or colloidal matter and consequently, light passing through matter is scattered. This characteristic of water that causes light scattering is referred to as turbidity. In the nephelometric method light scattered at 90 degrees to the incident light is measured. The whole water sample is shaken and poured into transparent cell or tube, which are allowed to sit for sufficient time to allow any air bubbles formed to escape before being placed in the nephelometer. A strong light beam is sent through the sample and the suspended particles reflect the light. The light which is reflected at 90 degrees to the axis is received by photo cells and their electrical response is proportional to the amount received and hence to the sample turbidity. Calibration of the instrument is made using a standard suspension of formazin- the reaction product of aqueous solutions of hydrazine sulphate and hexamethylenetetramine. The value is reported in units of NTU (nephelometric turbidity units).
 Ratiometric Method: The turbidity meter utilized has additional detectors that measures forward scattered light and light transmitted through the sample. Using a ratio of the light received by the different detectors to compute the turbidity value the variability of the turbidity reading can be reduced."
